# Student Health Analysis Answers:



### A. Demographics \& Mental Health:







1. Is there a difference in mental health risk levels between male and female students?



**Answer**: 100 males have a higher percentage of a lower risk level than 90 females. 343 males have a less percentage of a moderate risk level than 329 females. 6 males have a higher health\_risk level than 62 females.





2\. How does age relate to mental health risk among students?



Answer: According to the data, for each health risk level, the minimum heart rate is 50, overall.



* For a low health risk, the average heart rate is 70, while the maximum heart rate is 96. (Found among 190 students)
* For a moderate health risk, the average heart rate is 69, and the maximum heart rate is 99, the highest maximum heart rate. (Found amoung 672 students)
* For a high risk level, the average heart rate was also 69, and the maximum heart rate is 93 (found among 138 students.)







3\. Does blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) vary across mental health risk categories?





**Answer**: According to the data:



* Average blood systolic pressure starts to rise slightly from high to low risk level.
* Average blood diastolic rises and then comes down a little bit.











## B. Physiological Factors





Question 4: Do self-reported stress levels align with mental health risk levels?





Answer: According to the data,



* The most students who had a moderate risk level had a self report average of 5.
* The students with a high risk level had a self report of 7.
* The student with a low risk level had a self report of 2.









Question 5: How does sleep quality relate to mental health risk levels?



**Answer:** According to the data,





* Poor sleep quality leads to a high risk level.
* Good sleep quality leads to a lower risk level.
* Good sleep quality leads to a moderate risk level.







Question 6: Does the amount of daily physical activity differ across mental health risk levels?





**Answer:** According to the data,



* High physical activity results in a high health risk level.
* Moderate physical activity results in both a low and moderate health risk level.









### C. Stress (Measured vs Self-Reported)





Question 7: Does the amount of time spent on academic tasks relate to mental health risk levels?





Answer:  The average hours on projects over all health risk levels seem to be the same, but the highest average results in a moderate health risk level.













### Summary of My Report:



Gender Differences: Males had more low risk cases, while females had more high risk cases. Moderate risk levels were about the same, but slightly higher among females.





Age \& Heart Rate. Hear rates differences were minimal.





Blood Pressure: Average **systolic** pressure increased slightly across risk levels, while diastolic pressure rose and then slightly decreased.





Self-Reported Stress: Stressed levels increased consistently with risk level. There is a strong alignment between perceived stress and actual health risk.





Sleep Quality: Sleep plays a significant role in mental health. According to the data, poor sleep resulted in high health risk, while good sleep resulted in lower risk levels.





Physical Activity: High physical activity appeared in high risk students, while moderate activity resulted in both low and moderate risk levels. According to this information, physical activity alone does not determine health risk.







Academic Stress: Average project hours were similar across risk levels, but the highest averages were found in the moderate risk. Academics may contribute to stress but alone does not determine health risk.
